SaveWaterPipesSingleUnit
============================
The "Save The Water Pipes" Single Unit project is the code for the "Save The Water Pipes" system submitted online at hackster.io for the 2016 China US Young Maker Competition.

It is the "Single Unit" version of the system because we built a multi-unit version of the system later. To learn more about the competition and the differences between the two versions of the system, go to:

The "Single Unit" version of the system was built by re-purposing the sample Node.js application offered by Intel. You can read more about the sample application that this project was built on by reading README.md.orig
